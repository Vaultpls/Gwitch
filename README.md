# Gwitch
A upcoming framework to connect yourself to Twitch chat!

## Why?
This is an replacement but morely an improvement to my previous bot that was horribly coded and wasn't even in a framework.  I've attempted many times to create something better but I had data loss and times where I've not been in the right mind set to create something better.  Finally I was able to create this.  It's simpiler, easier to maintain, and best of all: a framework.

[Example of usage](https://github.com/Vaultpls/Gwitch/tree/master/example)

### Chat Data
*METHOD* - States if it were a JOIN/MESSAGE/etc
*Username* - States the referenced users name
*Message* - States the message received if MESSAGE was the METHOD

## TODO
* Twitch custom commands
* Others to come
